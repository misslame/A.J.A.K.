Virtual Environment Rules:
---------------------------------
*  Do not make your project within/inside your 
   same directory for your virtual environment.

*  If you add database to your project, do not push it. 

*  Do not push virtual environment. 

*  Make a virtual environment somewhere on your computer
   and work within the same folders as it as an example:
   
   SoftwareEngineeringProject\
        Virtual Environment\
        A.J.A.K.\
            _.gitignore
                web_project\
                bearbites\
                ... other apps folders
                templates\ (html pages)
                manage.py

* If you do not already have, install the following:
    - Microsoft® ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server® - Windows, Linux, & macOS
    https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56567
    
    - git 
    https://git-scm.com/downloads
    
    - Python3
    https://www.python.org/downloads/
    
* Download connection (for database) file and place it under bearbites\ folder. 
    [ ATTENTION ]  name this file _con.py instead of con.py. 
    Because windows prevents con.py files, mac users you will need to conform so that
    windows users dont struggle to get their thing working before figuring out they need to 
    change the code. Sorry. 
            

Virtual Environment Set Up Instructions:
------------------------------------------
1. Make new folder somewhere (suggested: desktop/documents/etc) 
   name it something that will help you remember what it is for. 
   (Software Engineering project)
   
2. Inside this folder, open up bash/terminal/shell/etc which ever you 
   prefer to use, but it needs to be a terminal. I used git bash. 

3. Make sure you have python 3 installed and pip. Check if you have python 2 also
   installed and be aware of it. Type in the terminal you are using 
        pip install virtualenv
   if you have python 2 on your machine, you need to type pip3 instead of pip

4. type the command
        python -m venv virtualEnvironmentName    
   I reccommend the name "deployDjango" or something to remind you its a django 
   environment. 

5. This next step depends if youre running windows or not. Type what is relevent: 
    Linux/Mac:
        source virtualEnvironmentName/bin/activate
    
    Windows:
        source virtualEnvironmentName/Scripts/activate
        
6. check your folder you made for Software Engineering that it has a folder
   named what you named your virtualEnvironmentName. Then do the following commands 
        pip install django
        pip install pyodbc
        pip install django-pyodbc
        pip install django-pyodbc-azure
   Again, if you have python 2 remember to use pip3 instead of pip. 
   
7. In your software engineering folder (contains your environment) DO NOT PUT IN YOUR VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
   clone the repo from github. Then, change directories into said folder. .

8. After youre inside, run the below command in your terminal:
        python manage.py runserver
   it should say "watching for file changes with StatReloader" at this point, 
   check to see if it is locally running. Type localhost:8000 in browser. 
   Note: if you are missing the database, you should get the error "module .con not found" or
   similar.
